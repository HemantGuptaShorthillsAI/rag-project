1. Which startup is the highest valued?
According to the text, Yello Mobile was one of the first unicorn startups in South Korea with a valuation of over $1 billion. However, Pine Labs has had its valuation increase to more than US$2 billion after raising funds led by US-based billionaire Stephen Mandel's hedge fund Lone Pine Capital.

But if we consider all the startups mentioned, then Pine Labs is currently the highest-valued startup with a valuation of $5 billion.

2. Which startup has the lowest evaluation?
The text does not explicitly mention which startup has the lowest valuation. However, according to the Wikipedia articles mentioned in the text:

* Afiniti's valuation is not mentioned.
* Taopiaopiao's valuation is not mentioned.
* Unqork's valuation is not mentioned.
* Xiaohongshu's valuation is not mentioned.

If we consider the current market trends and valuations of these startups, it's difficult to determine which one has the lowest valuation without more up-to-date information."

However, I can tell you that according to the article, NetDocuments released PatternBuilder in 2022, which is a ""document and workflow automation tool that enables law firms, legal teams, and the public sector to automate their expertise and processes so they can be repeated predictably.""

Additionally, it's mentioned that Troy Hunt, an Australian web security expert and founder of Have I Been Pwned?, announced a partnership with NordVPN as a strategic advisor in August 2020. This suggests that NordVPN (and potentially NetDocuments) may have some focus on security, but more information would be needed to confirm their specific security focus.

If you're looking for more detailed information about NetDocuments' focus on security, I would recommend checking out their official website or reaching out to them directly for more information."
